    "### Background and Prior Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Gentrification has major impacts on the communities it impacts. Predicting gentrification is of interest to members of the community, activists, and those interested in real estate. Governing magazine released a report on gentrification in the 50 largest US Cities, and UC Berkeley has launched the Urban Displacement Project to research gentrification in the Bay Area. Researchers have used past census data, crime data, and even social media data to predict gentrification in certain cities. Even building permit data has been postulated as a potential cause of gentrification.\n",
    "\tWe intend to use a combination of factors, some of which have been researched and others which haven’t, in order to predict gentrification in San Diego. Work into this field is just beginning and we hope to provide a novel perspective. While some of these approaches have been used individually, we intend to combine them with building permit data, which has only been suggested, and gentrification in surrounding areas, which is novel. In addition, none of this work has attempted to predict gentrification in San Diego. As residents of San Diego, it is of particular interest to us to explain and predict the changes we are currently witnessing.\n",

    "Unforunately, the extent of gentrification remains difficult to judge directly, and the lack of an official list of census tracts to have been gentrified makes it difficult to be able to use Machine Learning models to predict gentrification as a classification problem. Therefore, we decided to measure gentrification indirectly by taking a look at increasing housing prices as a function of metrics, which include white vs. minority population, criminal incidents, etc. We believe that if there is a high correlation between these metrics and increasing housing prices, then housing prices can be looked at in determining whether or not a tract is considered to be at risk of gentrification."

    "We hypothesize that the various metrics measured in our data will be effective as predictors of past housing prices and San Diego County. We predict that high counts of building permits, lower crime rates, and higher population of white residents will be factors that correlate with (but not conclusively cause) higher housing prices."

    "### Proposed Methods (from Project Proposal)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Cleaning\n",
    "Because we explicitly defined the data we need in our research question, it is pretty straightforward to just remove the extra information. We also plan to limit our data points to a certain time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Analysis\n",
    "To analyze the data, we actually planned on creating our own dataset, with the necessary information already extracted and combined from the datasets found online. After this cleaning, we can begin by first anonymizing the data which ensures that our potential project remains ethical in maintaining privacy of the data. Now that we’ve refined our data completely, we can begin the visualization process. We plan to start with a general scatterplot matrix, which allows us to generally see how different variables change in relation to one another. Continuing on this, other graphs such as a line graph can also provide interesting information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon completion of the visualization step, we are left with a multitude of graphs and charts, all displaying important data. Our final analysis step is a simple one, which is to find the correlation. This can be done many different times, each relating two separate variables together. Correlation can be calculated using the imported matplotlib package.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What to report\n",
    "We aim to present a correlation r that represents the strength of the relationship between our independent variables (building permits, crime rates, average age, and the percentage of white residents) and dependent variable (median income) which we used to operationalize gentrification. Along with that value, we will have graphs such as a scatterplot matrix that will help us visualize the relationships. \n",
    "\n",
    "Packages we plan to use:\n",

    "- pandas\n",
    "- scikitlearn\n",
    "- matplotlib\n",

    "\n",
    "The data we used is from a public source and most identifying information has already been removed so it is ethical for us to use it. Our analysis will be based on data collected in a specific location and from a specific time frame. This eliminates the potential for skewed data because we’re hoping to explore these biases and see what particular information can be found for this range. If however we encounter any non anonymized data, we can follow the Safe Harbour method to remove potentially harmful or revealing information. "

    "\n",
    "The goal of our project is not at all to advance any sort of claim about what most directly influences housing prices in the real world, but to apply concepts and methods learned in class to real-life data as a scientific exercise. However, the fact that we are using metrics such as percentage white population and percentage male population might put our project at risk for purposeful misinterpretation to advance certain agendas that ignore the broader context of all the societal factors that contribute to quality of life in an area. For example, if our model (or others like it) were to conclude that higher housing prices were a result of higher white and male populations, certain groups that would advocate for the existence for some sort of racial or gender-related superiority might point to and twist our model's projections as supporting their claims.

   "source": [
    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "If our analysis and hypotheses are indeed correct, we would have found a new method of predicting housing prices in a given area. The ability to predict such happenings can be a very useful tool for the real estate scene, politicians, and other activists vying for greater social equality. Our method of prediction, if successful, would identify the change in housing prices that our neighborhoods would go through. However, if our hypothesis is wrong, and/or our methods don’t work, then our project would still hold some value, since we would be able to conclude that the factors we chose to predict home value do not work, and that the change is probably the result of some other factors yet unconsidered. \n",
    "\n",
    "The largest obstacle we encountered was that our missing data. As a group, we wanted to analyze the San Diego area over a longer period of time (since 2010). However, because we were pulling information from so many different sources, we had to massively restrict our time range, which in turn restricts our data. Another problem was that we had to manually manipulate our data to match the “tracts” given in the census, since some of our data is in terms of neighborhoods, and those neighborhoods might not match across all the data sets. This, while not an extremely difficult process, still took time and energy to resolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Post-Analysis Conclusions\n",
    "From the analysis, we were unable to find an accurate model because of the lack of metrics. As seen in the post 2050 visualizations, the data is extremely skewed. For example, there are several tracts which are supposedly going to be about 99% white, male, with an average age of 4 years old. We also concluded that machine learning models aren't the best predictors for complex problems like these. The model ended up saying that the most important feature was percent bachelors, which we know, by many other research studies, is not true. That being said, our project had the potential to make great changes in how we view housing prices and hopefully contributed to our society's accumulated knowledge. \n"
