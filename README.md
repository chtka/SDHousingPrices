This is your group repository for your final project for COGS108. This repostory is private, including to other students in the class, but visible to all COGS108 instructors.

We have uploaded your Project Proposal here, and will provide comments and feedback on it here, as an issue. In the meantime, you are welcome and encouraged to use this repository to get started working on your project. 

This repository will be frozen on the due date - at 11:59pm on Thursday, March 22nd, 2018.

Make sure you have a notebook called 'FinalProject.ipynb' present in this repository by the due date. 

Your final project will be graded based solely on that project notebook - make sure it has everything included and displayed (with code outputs) to evaluate your project. 


(IMPORTANT: Note to the Graders from Group 12)
Our final submission file is the FinalProject.ipynb file located in branch master of our GitHub repository.

One submission issue that we haven't been able to resolve is the inability to view our final Jupyter Notebook submission file properly on GitHub or downloaded as a standalone file. For some reason, our Jupyter Notebook file only displays properly when cloned as part of the repository and opened using the Jupyter Notebook desktop application.
